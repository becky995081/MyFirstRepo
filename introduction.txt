# Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Rebecca Elias. I hold a degree in Guidance and Counselling with a specialization in English. Currently, I am enrolled in the ALX Pathway Programme, an initiative designed to equip young Africans with leadership and entrepreneurial skills. Based in Lagos, Nigeria, I am deeply passionate about continuous learningâ€”embracing the processes of learning, unlearning, and relearning to foster personal and professional growth.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a profound love for singing, which allows me to express myself creatively and connect with others on an emotional level. I am excited to embark on this GitHub journey to showcase my projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
